# Ensure this matches or is compatible with your project's requirements (>=18.17.0 in package.json).

entrypoint: npm run start

runConfig:
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
  # Adjust based on expected load.
  maxInstances: 2

# The build command (npm run build) is typically inferred correctly for Next.js 
# by App Hosting buildpacks when package.json is found.
# If issues persist, you might need to add a buildConfig section:
# buildConfig:
#  buildCommand: npm run build
#  enforced: true # Ensure this build command is used.
# If your app's package.json is not at the root of your repository,
# specify the sourceDirectory. For example, if it's in an 'app' folder:
# sourceDirectory: app/
